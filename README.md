# BlackJack

Blackjack is a popular casino game played against the dealer. Whoever's cards get closest too or equal 21 wins. In this edition of the game, an 'Ace' has a value of 11, while Jack, Queen and King all have a value of 10. The rest of the cards stay at face value. Also, the dealer must continue receiving cards until their score value is a minimum of 16.
